- agc.id: id of the anaesthetic gas canister (AGC).
- agc.number: number (study related) of the AGC (starts with 1 per or.id)
- bottle.number: number (study related) of the sevoflurane bottle (could be 1 to 10).

The AGCs were closed with the "red cap" when the initial weight was measured.

- agc.id: id of the anaesthetic gas canister (AGC).
- initial.weight: initial weight of the unused AGC.

## setting.csv

- center.id: id of the center.
- or.id: id of the operating room.
